As grano is under active development, there isn't currently a hosted instance of the service. The easiest way to get involved is to install the package on a server.

Before you do so, you might want to check out [the feature list](/about/features) and the [development roadmap](/contributing/roadmap).

1. [Install grano](/docs/install) on your own server, and install the  [extensions](/extensions) that you need.
2. Import data about people, companies and other entities - and their relations between each other. You can use [granoloader](http://github.com/granoproject/granoloader) or the [grano user interface](http://github.com/granoproject/grano-ui).
3. Build your own influence mapping site, based on [MachtVZ](http://github.com/pudo/kompromatron) or [connectedAfrica](http://github.com/CodeForAfrica/connectedAfrica).
