Grano is a free software project, developed by coders, journalists and enthusiasts from all around the world. We rely on people contribute new ideas, bug fixes and modular extensions to build an investigative tools ecosystem.

If you want to contribute, here are some ways to get started:

* **Check out the [project roadmap](/roadmap)** to get an overview of where the project is heading and what the overall priorities are.
* **Subscribe to the [developers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/grano-dev)** to be part of our discussion and stay informed about new functions. Once you're signed up, drop the list an email and introduce yourself.
* **Install the [development environment](/docs/install)**, including the backend and user interface.
* **Fix some bugs** from the core engine's [issue tracker](https://github.com/granoproject/grano/issues?state=open). We like nice code, please make sure your code passes pylint, pep8 and has tests.
* **Explore our [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/granoproject)** to see available extensions and experimental repositories. Consider contributing your own extension.
