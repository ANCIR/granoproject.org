      <h3>Adaptable</h3>
      <p>Influence mapping projects have different objectives, and require custom interfaces. Grano is built to be an adaptable, plugin-based toolkit that can be tailored to a specific mode of analysis.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>Collaboratively Built</h3>
      <p>Grano is built by an open network of collaborators working in journalism and advocacy. This means you'll never depend on one company, but work with a team of like-minded projects to build a shared stack of analytic capabilities.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h3>Integrate Many Sources</h3>
